### Countermovement Jump Consistency Analysis
This repository contains my research on athlete jump consistency using deep learning and statistical methods. The goal is to analyze force-time curves from countermovement jumps (CMJ) to assess how consistency changes with training.

### 🔍 Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalization of jump data based on force-time characteristics.
Autoencoder Model: Implementation of an autoencoder in PyTorch to reconstruct and analyze force curves.
Statistical Analysis: Evaluating consistency using variance metrics and correlation analysis.
Visualization: Graphical representation of normalized jumps and reconstructions.
### 📊 Research Context
This project explores the relationship between training time and jump consistency, hypothesizing that athletes become more consistent with more training. It is part of a broader study in sports science and deep learning applications.
